	* impacket/dcerpc/dcerpc_v4.py (DCERPC_v4.bind): support idempotent flag.
	(DCERPC_v4.send): reduced fragment size to avoid IP fragmentation on links with MTU = 1500. Added a method that allows the caller to configure this size.

	* impacket/dcerpc/dcerpc_v4.py (DCERPC_v4.bind): made self.__bind protected
